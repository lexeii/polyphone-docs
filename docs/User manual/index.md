## Left part


### Opening a soundfont

Three ways for opening a soundfont:

  - a click on “**Open a file**” opens a file browser, the allowed file to
    select having the extension sf2, sf3, sfArk or sfz (the different formats
    are described [here][the-different-soundfont-formats]);
  - a click on “**Create a soundfont**” opens an empty soundfont, everything is
    to be done from scratch;
  - a double-click on a soundfont from the history re-open it.

When a soundfont is open, a new tab appears with a [soundfont editor] inside.


### Shortcuts

Three buttons are located at the bottom of the left part:

  - **Documentation**  
    Open a web browser for reading the Polyphone [documentation].
  - **Forum**  
    Open a web browser with the URL of the Polyphone [forum].
  - **Settings**  
    Open the [settings] of the software in a new tab.

### Online repository

A click on the button “Online repository” opens a tab with the

tab with the corresponding [soundfont description].


### Search

It is possible to write a keyword here for searching specific soundfonts and the
results will be displayed in the [soundfont browser].
