# Instrument editor

When clicking on one or more instrument(s) in the [tree], the editing page
of instruments appears.

This page comprises several parts:

  - the [table],
  - the [range editor] when the button “Edit ranges” from the [toolbar]
    is clicked,
  - the [envelope editor] when the button “Edit envelope” from the [toolbar]
    is clicked,
  - the [modulator section].

![instrument page]

If only one instrument is selected, the page allows the editing of the global
parameters of the instrument and the parameters of all its divisions.

In the case where several instruments are selected, the global parameters of
each of these instruments can be edited.

## Table


### Presentation

The table allows a global view and the editing of an instrument configuration.
A change of a parameter in the “global” division applies to all divisions,
except for divisions whose same parameter is already specified.

The editable parameters are:

  - **Key range**  
    Key range for which the sound will be heard.

  - **Velocity range**  
    Velocity range for which the sound will be heard. It is possible to set
    different sounds for the same note, with different velocity ranges (to
    distinguish different nuances of a piano key for example).

  - **Attenuation**  
    Attenuation in decibel applied to the sample.  
    Note: the sf2 format doesn't allow this value to be negative, no
    amplification is thus possible.

  - **Pan**  
    Balance applied to the sound, to hear it to the left or to the right in
    stereo.

  - **Loop playback**  
    ![loop off] indicates a sound reproduced with no loop,  
    ![loop on] indicates a sound which loops continuously,  
    ![loop on with end] indicates a sound which loops for the duration of key
    depression and then proceeds to play the remainder of the sample.  
    Note: the sf2 format had no plans for a special playback mode which triggers
    a sample when a key is released. One way to achieve this behavior is to
    double each sample with a sample containing a short silent loop followed by
    the sound to emit on the release. The added sample will be read with the
    playback parameter “loop on with end”.

  - **Root key**  
    Allows you to change the normal root key of a sample to a different note
    from that usually used.

  - **Tuning**  
    Change the tuning in semitones and cents of semitones. Changing “scale”
    plays on the difference between two consecutive notes.

  - **Filter**  
    Apply a low-pass filter, by specifying the cutoff frequency and the
    resonance.

  - **Volume envelope**  
    Change the volume envelope, and possibly how it changes with the note.

  - **Modulation**  
    Set a modulation (envelope, delay, frequency, changes with the note) and its
    effect on the tone, filter and volume.

  - **Vibrato**  
    Set a vibrato (time, frequency) and its effect on the tone.

  - **Exclusive class**  
    This parameter can define one or more exclusive classes, by assigning a set
    of sounds within a class the same parameter value other than 0. When an
    exclusive class is defined, any note triggered from one of the sounds of the
    exclusive class ends all the other sounds of the same class. The scope of
    an exclusive class is the preset in which the class is defined (a sound
    triggered in an instrument will end a sound of another instrument if the
    two instruments are in the same preset). This effect can be used for
    percussion instruments like a cymbal. Basically playing one note
    automatically terminates another in the same group.

  - **Chorus and reverb**  
    Indicates the intensity of chorus and reverb effects. The effects are
    configurable in the software [settings][sound settings].

  - **Fixed key and velocity**  
    Can freeze the key and velocity on the key range specified by the linked
    sample.

  - **Offsets**  
    Changes the positions of the start and end of a sound during playback, as
    well as the start and end of the loop. The unit of an offset is samples
    (number of values).


### Editing facilities in the table

To facilitate and speed up editing in the table, the following features have
been implemented:

  - the mouse wheel may be used to change a value (the cell has to be in edit
    mode first),
  - a keyboard can be used to set the rootkey, key range and velocity range
    (the cell has to be in edit mode first),
  - a multiple selection, followed by the editing of the last cell, will edit
    all cells simultaneously,
  - the keys <kbd>Del</kbd> and <kbd>Backspace</kbd> clear the content of all
    selected cells,
  - stereo divisions may be edited simultaneously if the option is enables in
    the software [preferences][general settings],
  - key names may be numeric or as a text (having C3, C4 or C5 as middle C),
    depending on the option chosen in the [preferences][interface settings],
  - copy / paste / cut of a set of cells (not necessarily adjacent) may be done
    via <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>.

Do not forget the [tools] available! In particular the tool allowing a
[key-based configuration].


### Possibility to mute divisions

For testing purposes, it is possible to mute a division or mute all divisions
but one in the tables. The options are accessible with a right click on the
header of a division.

## Key range editor

The key range editor allows you to quickly and graphically dispose samples
according to their key and velocity ranges. This graph further highlights
configuration problems, such as zones free of samples or unwanted
superpositions.

![key range editor]

Each sample is represented by a rectangle. The color is semitransparent, so that
the superposition of several elements is identifiable.


### Rectangle selection

A simple left click on a rectangle will select it and removes all other
selections. If several rectangles are superimposed, consecutive clicks change
the selection under the mouse cursor.

A multiple selection is possible:

  - by maintaining button <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and then clicking on the different
    rectangles to select one by one,
  - by using button <kbd>Shift</kbd>: all rectangles between the first rectangle
    being clicked and the next one will be selected.


### Updating the rectangles

After having selected one or more rectangle(s), it is possible with the left
button to:

  - change the size, when you grab one of the edges of a rectangle;
  - change the position, by pointing to the center of a rectangle.

If several rectangles are selected, all changes are made synchronously.


### Drag & zoom

Maintaining the right click allows you to change the zoom around the selected
point.

Maintaining the left click allows you to move the graphic if the initial point
is not on a rectangle.

## Envelope editor

The envelope editor provides a graphical overview of the 8 parameters defining
the volume envelope and the 8 parameters defining the modulation envelope. This
is thus a tool for better understanding the impact of each of these parameters.

![envelope editor interface]

The buttons above the graph select alternatively the volume envelope (displayed
in green) or the modulation envelope (displayed in red) for the editing. During
the editing of the modulation envelope, the volume envelope is displayed with
a thin line.

The left part of the graph represents the evolution of the envelope when a key
is **triggered**. 7 of the 8 parameters are involved in this representation:

  - **Delay**: duration during which the envelope remains at 0 just after a key
    is triggered,
  - **Attack**: duration after **delay** during which the envelope grows from 0
    to the maximum value,
  - **Hold**: duration after **attack** during which the envelope keeps its
    maximum value,
  - **Decay**: duration after **hold** during which the envelope progressively
    goes from the maximum value to the value specified by **sustain**,
  - **Sustain**: value after **decay** sustained as long as the triggered key
    is not released,
  - **Key → Hold**: change of the **hold** duration depending on the key
    (see below),
  - **Key → Decay**: change of the **decay** duration depending on the key
    (see below).

A positive value in **Key → XXX** gradually decreases the duration of XXX toward
the trebles, whereas a negative value does the opposite. For instance:

  - value 100 halve the duration of XXX per octave above middle C (60) and
    double the duration of XXX per octave below middle C,
  - value -100 double the duration of XXX per octave above middle C (60) and
    halve the duration of XXX per octave above middle C.

The right part represents the evolution of the envelope when a key is
**released**. Only the **release** duration is involved in this representation.
The envelope gradually returns to 0 during this duration.

When only one division of an instrument is selected in the tree, the
corresponding sound [sample] is displayed on the background. It is thus
possible to better visualize the evolution of the envelope relative to the
sample being played.

## Modulators

The lower section of the editing page of instruments is intended for the
creation of modulators, globally for an instrument or for a particular division.
When you play an instrument, a modulator listens to one or two MIDI signal(s)
and modify one of the parameters in the table according to the mathematical rule
configured. The output of a modulator can also be used as input to another
modulator (this function appeared in version 2.04 of [sf2 format] and may not be
supported by some synthesizers).

![modulator editor]

Buttons on the left are made for:

  - expanding / collapsing the modulator area,
  - adding / removing a modulator,
  - copying / pasting / duplicating one or more modulators.

When a modulator is added, the border of the corresponding cell in the table is
thicker (see the tuning in the global column above).
