# Soundfont editor

When a soundfont is created or when an existing one is opened, a new tab
containing a soundfont editor appears.

![soundfont editor]

A soundfont editor is made of:

  - a [tree] on the left, representing the architecture of the soundfont;
  - a [toolbar] on the top (in blue in the picture);
  - a main area that can either contain an [editing page] or an
    [configuration summary], depending on what is selected in the [tree].



[tree]:                  tree.md
[toolbar]:               toolbar.md
[editing page]:          editing-pages/index.md
[configuration summary]: configuration-summaries.md
