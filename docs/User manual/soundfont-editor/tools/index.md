# Tools

Once you understand how soundfonts work (through the different [editors]), tools
are probably what you should care of. They are all designed to fasten / automate
the editing and to avoid common errors or imprecision that a human usually does.

Tools are all available in a menu that is displayed when clicking on the toolbox
icon in the [toolbar]. The content of this menu depends on the selection in the
[tree]: first on the kind of selection (as described below) but also on the
number of selected elements. A few tools cannot process multiple elements so
they will be hidden with a multiple selection.


## Global tools

When the header “General” is selected in the [tree], the tool menu is filled
with [global tools].

## Sample tools

When one or more samples are selected in the [tree], the tool menu is filled
with [sample tools].

## Instrument tools

When one or more instruments (including the divisions) are selected in the
[tree], the tool menu is filled with [instrument tools].

## Preset tools

When one or more presets (including the divisions) are selected in the [tree],
the tool menu is filled with [preset tools].
