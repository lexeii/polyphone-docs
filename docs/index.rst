Opening a soundfont
-------------------

Three ways for opening a soundfont:

* a click on “**Open a file**” opens a file browser, the allowed file to select
  having the extension sf2, sf3, sfArk or sfz (the different formats are
  described `here <the different soundfont formats_>`_);
* a click on “**Create a soundfont**” opens an empty soundfont, everything is
  to be done from scratch;
* a double-click on a soundfont from the history re-open it.

When a soundfont is open, a new tab appears with a `soundfont editor`_ inside.
